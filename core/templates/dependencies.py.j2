"""
Dependency Injection for the '{{name}}' app.

This module contains functions that can be used as FastAPI dependencies
to provide services, repositories, or other resources to the API endpoints.

By defining dependencies here, you can centralize the logic for obtaining
and configuring resources, making your endpoints cleaner and more testable.

Example:
    from fastapi import Depends, APIRouter
    from .services.some_service import SomeService

    router = APIRouter()

    def get_some_service() -> SomeService:
        # This could involve getting a DB session, etc.
        return SomeService()

    @router.get("/")
    def list_items(service: SomeService = Depends(get_some_service)):
        return service.get_all()
"""

# Add your app-specific dependency functions here.
